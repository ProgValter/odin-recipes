    <h1>Chicken Flautas</h1>
    <img src="images/chicken.jpeg">
    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>From burritos to quesadillas, you really can’t go wrong with 
        chicken wrapped in a tortilla! Flautas are our new favorite 
        obsession. Made with shredded chicken wrapped in flour 
        tortillas and then pan-fried, they’re somewhere between 
        taquitos and chimichangas. They come together quickly, making 
        them perfect party appetizers or a great weeknight meal served 
        with Mexican rice and beans.

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 c. shredded, cooked chicken</li>
        <li>1/4 c. canned, chopped green chiles</li>
        <li>1 c. shredded cheddar</li>
        <li>1 c. queso blanco (or crumbled feta)</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. kosher salt (omit if chicken is already seasoned)</li>
        <li>2 tsp. hot sauce, optional</li>
        <li>10 7" flour tortillas</li>
        <li>1/2 c. vegetable, canola, or other neutral oil</li>
    </ul>
     <h2>How to Make Chicken Flautas</h2>
     <ol>
         <li>In a large bowl, combine chicken, chiles, cheeses, salt, 
             and hot sauce (if using).</li>
         <li>Lay 1 tortilla down on a work surface. Spread a heaping 
             1/4 cup of the chicken mixture onto the bottom third of 
             the tortilla. Roll up tightly and place seam side down on 
             a plate. Repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.</li>
         <li>In a 10” skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat until 
             the temperature reaches between 350-375 degrees F. 
             (You want to hear a sizzle as soon as the food hits 
             the oil.)</li>
         <li>Add 3 of the flautas to the oil, seam side down. Cook, 
             turning every 30 to 60 seconds, until golden all over, 
             about 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer flautas to a large paper 
             towel-lined plate or baking sheet. Repeat with remaining 
             flautas. Serve immediately with pico de gallo, sour cream, 
             and guacamole.</li>
