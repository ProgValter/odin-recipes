    <h1>Salmon Chowder</h1>
    <img src="images/salmon.jpg">
    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>The easiest way to get the taste of a cool crisp seaside day 
        no matter where you live is a bowl of steaming hot salmon 
        chowder. This version is packed with tender, flaky fish, fresh 
        sweet corn kernels, and rings of spicy jalapeño. Similar to a 
        classic New England clam chowder, this recipe has all the most 
        important qualities of a good chowder, aka it's a thick seafood 
        soup or stew that combines vegetables with other ingredients like 
        cream, corn, and potatoes.</p>

     <h2>How to Make Salmon Chowders</h2>
     <ol>
         <li>In a large pot over medium heat, cook bacon, stirring 
             occasionally, until golden and crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. 
             Transfer bacon to a paper towel-lined plate; discard any 
             excess fat.</li>
         <li>Return pot to medium heat. Cook leeks and butter, stirring
             occasionally, until tender, about 2 minutes. Stir in 
             garlic and minced jalapeño and cook, stirring constantly, 
             until garlic is golden and fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
         <li>Add potatoes, water, clam juice, thyme, bay leaf, 1 1/4 
             tsp. salt, and 1/2 tsp. black pepper. Bring to a boil, 
             then cover and reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer until 
             potatoes are knife-tender, about 10 minutes. </li>
         <li>Increase heat to medium-high. Season salmon with 1/2 tsp. 
             salt and add to pot along with cooked bacon, corn, and 
             cream. Cook, stirring gently a few times (so you don’t 
             break up salmon too much), until salmon is just cooked 
             through and corn is crisp-tender, about 4 minutes. Stir 
             in lemon juice and half of parsley; season with salt and 
             black pepper.</li>
             <li>Divide soup among bowls. Top with remaining parsley 
                 and sliced jalapeño.</li>
         
     </ol>
